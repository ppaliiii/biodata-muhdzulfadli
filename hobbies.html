    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    
    <img src="drawing.jpg" alt="Drawing Hobby">
    <p>One of my favorite ways to unwind is through drawing, especially when I find myself with some extra time. I find that sketching helps me relax and allows me to express creativity freely. Another hobby that keeps me energized is weight training. I enjoy working out with weights, as it not only strengthens my body but also serves as a great stress reliever. I also recently find a new hobby which is hiking and I have climbed many mountains and hills together with my mum and friends.</p>
    
    <img src="music.jpg" alt="Music Listening">
    <p>In addition to these activities, I have a strong passion for music. My playlists are diverse, including genres like K-pop, J-pop, hip-hop, and malay songs, each bringing a unique vibe to my day. Sudirman and Eminem are two of my favorite artists, and their music has had a lasting influence on me. My favorite song of all time is *Pelangi Petang* by Sudirman Hj Arshad because I am a fan of his unique voice and the melody of the song.</p>
